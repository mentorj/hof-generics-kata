# Higher Order Functions & Generics kata

## Kata steps

### Step 1: 
write with standard for loops the following functions

* add (x,y) -> x + y , x,y as integers
* multiply ( x,y) -> x*y , x,y as integers
* substract (x,y) -> x -y , x,y as integers

### Step 2 :
Comments about the code ? Can you see some patterns ?

### Step 3 :
Can you refactor your code introducing a more generic function (using VAVR Functions or not)

### Step 4 : 
What happens if you wish to write even more generic functions enabling to use
* add (x,y) -> x+y , x,y as double
* and so on
