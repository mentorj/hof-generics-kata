# Higher Order Functions & Generics kata

## Kata steps

### Step 1:
Write the followi ng functions

* add (x,y) -> x + y , x,y as integers
* multiply ( x,y) -> x*y , x,y as integers
* substract (x,y) -> x -y , x,y as integers


Now using a list (VAVR or plain Java) use them with a list using the filter & map  functions.
Write a short main() function to try it out!!
Try to obtain a display close from this one.

### Step 2 :
Now the list contains double instead of integers.
Consequences on your code base.
You should obtain running the problem an output close to

### Step 3 :
Comments about the code ...
How to refactor the code 

### Step 4 : 
What happens if you wish to write even more generic functions enabling to use
* add (x,y) -> x+y , x,y as double
* and so on
